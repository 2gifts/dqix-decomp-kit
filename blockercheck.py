"""Rank measured blockers by class and hold the dispatcher while one class keeps recurring uncracked.

    python blockercheck.py [--verbose]

A class counts as ADDRESSED when worker_src/core.md cites the ADDRESS of one of its members: crack
one, write the recipe, and every later member of that class is free. Only rows recorded AFTER that
citation count against the class again. A class not worth a recipe goes in wlog/blockers_declined.txt
as `<CLASS> <reason>`. Exit 1 while any class is over threshold.
