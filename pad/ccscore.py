"""Score a candidate under EVERY mwccarm build, with the per-case classified score.

The earlier compiler matrix compared raw byte distance on a source whose frame was still wrong, so
every 2.0 build looked identical and the question was written off. Byte distance is the wrong
objective (it counts relocations and pools) and a wrong-length source hides build differences
anyway. This runs pad/casescore.py under each build instead, which is the number that tracks real
work — and some functions in this project only match under a non-default build, so the build is a
variable to search, not a constant.

Usage: python ccscore.py <file.cpp> [--only 2.0]
