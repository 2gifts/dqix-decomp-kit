"""Build a per-FUNCTION worker doc containing only the recipes that function can actually need.

    python recipe_select.py <mod> <addr> [--stats]      -> writes doc_cache/<mod>_<addr>.md, prints path

WHY THIS EXISTS. The full doc is 1,734 lines / 118 KB, and a worker's Read of it is TRUNCATED:
measured from three worker transcripts on 2026-08-20, sections up to ~line 666 appeared in the Read
result and sections from ~line 1236 onward did not. Roughly the back half of the doc has never
reached a single session. Reordering only chooses which half gets cut. Splitting recipes behind an
on-demand fetch was already measured too, and was worse -- of 55 sessions under SPLIT_RECIPES, ZERO
opened the recipes file, and the large band went 0-for-5.

So the doc must be SMALL and it must already contain the right recipes -- neither truncated nor
fetched. Selection is mechanical: recipes are keyed by instruction SHAPES, and the target listing is
right there. Scan the listing, keep the sections whose shapes appear, drop the rest. Zero model
tokens, and the cost is one disassembly the worker was going to read anyway.
