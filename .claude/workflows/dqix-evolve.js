BOARD ${BOARD} lists everything already tried. Read \`tail -60\` of it first -- never the whole file, it is large.
Append ONE line per scored file:  echo "EVO <your label> <fitness> <sig> <the edit in a few words>" >> ${BOARD}
SCORE:   ${SCORER} <file> [<file> ...]     one JSON line per file; fitness 0 = MATCH; sig names each differing site
INSPECT: cd ${REPO} && WDIFF_CTX=2 python ${KIT}/wdiff.py ${MOD} ${ADDR} <file>${CASEDIFF}
The source must be something the original developers could have written: NO #pragma of any kind, no always_inline or noinline
attributes, no compiler overrides, no fake extra call arguments, no assembly. The scorer rejects such files.
AND WHEN A SITE RESISTS EVERY FORM, THE RESIDUE IS POINTING AT CODE SOMEBODY INVENTED. Read the whole file for constructs
the developers could not have written -- a template or macro system for field access, several spellings of the same access
picked per site for their codegen, a variable reused for two unrelated things, a store nested inside another store's operand,
one object cast to several struct types. Each of those changes what mwcc knows about ALIASING and about common
subexpressions, which is what decides scheduling and register choice. Replace them with the natural form (one typed struct
with named members, accessed as self->field) and re-measure, accepting a worse number to be in the right basin. Do this
BEFORE the third attempt at one site, not after the seventh.
MINE BEFORE YOU GUESS -- the ROM's own form is usually written down somewhere already, and reading it
costs a fraction of a blind variant sweep:
* THE CORPUS. Committed matching sources are proof of what mwcc emits for a C form. Find ones whose
  ROM code has the pairing you cannot produce: \`python ${KIT}/pad/findshape.py [--twonode]\`,
  \`pad/findladder.py\`, \`pad/shapecat.py\`, or a plain grep over ${REPO}/src for the mnemonics or the
  constant. Map a source to its address by its \`// USA:\` comment as well as by its filename, or you
  will miss every semantically-named file. Then read that file's C and copy the FORM, not the text.
* REFERENCE DECOMPS. \`${SP}/refs\` holds verified NDS decomps. Their C is evidence; a splitter
  dump (\`arm_func_start\`) is NOT -- it is the same assembly you already have.
* THE WEB, when the function looks like library, SDK or runtime code rather than game logic: a
  distinctive identifier, string or constant often finds the original C. WebSearch and WebFetch, and
  \`gh search code "<identifier>"\` for other decomps. That is how 020042a8 was identified as MSL
  \`__strtold\` from \`hex_scan_state\`. A decomp.me scratch fetch needs a browser User-Agent and a
  Referer header.
Say in your report which of these you searched and what you found, so the next generation does not
repeat it.
PROBE BEFORE YOU SWEEP. Compiling the whole function to test one construct costs a minute; a 10-line
probe costs a second:  python ${KIT}/pad/probe_cc.py <probe.cpp> --bytes  prints the codegen of a
scratch file built with the project compiler and flags. Reproduce the ROM's instruction pairing in a
probe, sweep twenty forms there in the time one whole-function compile takes, then apply only the
winners to the real file. A probe is NOT faithful on its own -- it omits the surrounding code that
decides scheduling and register pressure -- so every probe answer is a candidate, and the scorer on
the real function is what settles it.
Work only in your own directory (create it). Never edit your parent file, src/, attempts/ or another agent's files. Never commit.
Score several variants in ONE scorer call. Keep the best-scoring file you produced even when it is WORSE than your parent:
a file that is wrong at a different site can be the branch that leads to MATCH. Report that file.`
