"""Full decoded listing of the TARGET function -- exactly its slot, never truncated.

WHY. The worker doc told workers to read the target with `grep -rhA80 "^func_ovNNN_ADDR:"`. That is 80
LINES, which is fine for the small tier and silently wrong for the large one: the median unmatched
>256B function in ov017 is 512B = 128 instructions, so -A80 showed 62% of it, and the largest is 6400B
= 1600 instructions, of which it showed 5%. Workers were being asked to byte-match functions whose
tails they had never seen -- which is a far better explanation for the large tier's 1.0 PASS/worker
than difficulty is.

Reads the PRISTINE ROM bytes for the symbol's exact size, so the listing is complete by construction
and needs no build. Pool words that decode as bogus instructions are shown as `.word` when they are
the target of a pc-relative load, so they are not mistaken for code.

Usage: python wlist.py <OV|main> <addr>
