# THE kill for this project. Use nothing else.
#
# Why this exists. Git-Bash `kill -9` on a worker only kills the POSIX-side `timeout`/`claude` wrapper.
# The real spender is a WINDOWS process (`claude.exe -p "DQIX decomp worker…"`), which survives, gets
# reparented to PID 1, and keeps burning tokens with no driver left to collect its output. Measured
# 08-12: three orphaned claude.exe workers ran on after their driver was killed, outside the governor,
# and every earlier "killed the fleet" in this session left some behind. limit_guard's kill_workers has
# the same hole -- it scans /proc cmdlines, which never sees a detached claude.exe.
#
# Order matters: supervisor FIRST (else it relaunches run_all mid-kill), then drivers, then workers.
# Workers are killed on BOTH sides: POSIX wrappers and the Windows claude.exe children.
#
# The session's own interactive claude.exe is identified by NOT carrying the worker prompt, so it is
# never a candidate -- do not "simplify" this to killing all claude.exe.
#
# Usage:
#   bash killfleet.sh              kill workers only (leave supervisor/drivers running)
#   bash killfleet.sh --all        kill supervisor, drivers and workers
#   bash killfleet.sh --orphans    kill only workers whose parent is gone
#   bash killfleet.sh --dry        report what would be killed, kill nothing
