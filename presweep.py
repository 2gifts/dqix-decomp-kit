"""Run the free rewrites on an address BEFORE a paid worker sees it.

    python presweep.py <main|NNN> <addr>     -> prints MATCH <file>, IMPROVED <a> <b>, or nothing

colorsweep only ever ran inside repairsweep, on an hourly timer over a 475-candidate pool walked
sequentially, so the chance it had recently touched the address a worker was about to claim was
small -- and the worker prompt then asked the WORKER to run it, paying tokens for a mechanical
rewrite that costs CPU. Every rule in colorsweep is meaning-preserving and gated, so there is no
reason a session should ever be the first thing to try them.

Two outcomes worth having:
  * MATCH    -- the address is closed for free and no worker is spawned at all.
  * IMPROVED -- clsbest is replaced, so the doc's "START HERE" artifact is the swept one and the
                session begins past everything the rules can reach.

Nothing happens on an address with no artifact yet: there is nothing to rewrite until a first
source exists, which is what a worker is for.
