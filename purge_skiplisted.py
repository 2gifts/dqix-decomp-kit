"""Move skiplisted sources OUT of every directory an integrator reads.

Usage: python purge_skiplisted.py [--dry]

An integrator should not have to know what a skiplist is. It integrates what it finds, so a
skiplisted function must simply not be there: `integrate_fast` takes its candidates from untracked
src/ and from staging/, and a single skiplisted file in either is enough to red a combined build for
the whole ROM. 0208f588 is the worked example -- skiplisted as "byte-exact per function but shifts
the ARM9 link", it fails `check modules` for ARM9 main every time, and one NOSKIP wave that left its
source in src/ was enough to red the next combined build with it.

Files are MOVED, never deleted, into skiplisted_hold/ so the attempt survives for whenever the
address comes off the skiplist. Run this after any NOSKIP wave and before any integration.
