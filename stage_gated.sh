# wgate.py copies a source into gated/<mod>/<addr>.cpp ONLY on a MATCH -- "the one place in the
# pipeline where a match is PROVEN". 801 accumulated there and no dispatcher ever read the
# directory, so 112 addresses whose exact bytes had already matched sat uncommitted.
#
# This does NOT re-gate. finish_wave gates and classifies anyway, and it is the authority: a wgate
# MATCH masks relocations, so it can pass a wrong-callee function that still fails the overlay
# checksum. Staging is the cheap half; the wave decides.
#
# Secure-area addresses (< 0x02000800) are staged too -- land_harvest.sh parks them back out and
# feeds them one per wave, because their layout drift is cumulative.
