# CONTINUOUS budget-driven dispatch: keep N slots working, recycle each one as it spends its share,
# integrate what lands, and keep going until every module's pool is empty.
# Usage: bash pull_all.sh          (run detached; stop with `touch $SP/STOP_PULL`)
#
# WHY THIS REPLACES THE BATCH DRIVER. run_module fixed three things in advance -- functions per
# worker, seconds per worker, workers per wave -- and none of them bounded what actually matters.
# Two sessions took $1,135 of one week's $2,828 without exceeding any of them, because a fast worker
# burns turns inside its time limit. Here the only hard limit is money, per unit of work, and both
# knobs are live:
#
#   PULL_SLOTS    how many run at once   (burn rate)
#   PULL_BUDGET   dollars per slot-run   (how far one slot goes before it is recycled)
#
# Both are re-read every cycle, so either can be changed while this runs -- no restart, no redeploy.
# A slot that exhausts its budget exits and is respawned with a fresh one, which is the recycling:
# sessions stay short (cost per message climbs with length) while the slot keeps working.
